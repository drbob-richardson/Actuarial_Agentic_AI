            "1. Fine Dining Restaurants: These are acceptable due to their moderate risk profile. They have a maximum floor area of 7,500 square feet, seating capacity no greater than 150, and sales of beer, wine or liquor no greater than 75% of total sales. Catering must not exceed 15% of total sales and there are no bar operations during hours when full table service is not available. This indicates a controlled environment with a focus on food rather than alcohol consumption.\n",
            "2. Brewpubs: These are acceptable as they primarily manufacture beer, ale or malt liquor alcoholic beverages and sell such products on a retail basis for consumption on their premises along with appetizers or meals. They have similar eligibility requirements to fine dining restaurants, including a maximum floor area of 7,500 square feet and seating capacity no greater than 150. Off-site sales of beer, ale or malt liquor alcoholic beverages must not exceed 25% of total sales.\n",
            "3. Quick Service Restaurants: These are acceptable as they include limited cooking type appliances and only certain cooking processes.

            "2. Restaurants with Seasonal Operations: These are declined as they are closed for more than 30 consecutive days, which may increase the risk of property damage or theft.\n",
            "3. Restaurants with High Alcohol Sales: Restaurants where alcohol sales exceed the specified limits (75% for fine dining restaurants, 25% for limited cooking and quick service restaurants, and 50% for full service restaurants) are declined due to the increased risk associated with high alcohol consumption.\n",
