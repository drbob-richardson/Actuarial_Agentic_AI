## Global Underwriting Requirements


Requirement:
1. All businesses must adhere to the policy’s applicable perils, limits of insurance, and other applicable policy terms and provisions.

Explanation:

This requirement is **mandatory** for all businesses covered under the Business Owner Policy. It implies that businesses must comply with all the terms and conditions, including the perils covered, the limits of insurance, and other policy provisions as stipulated in the policy.

Applicable Perils:

The policy covers specific perils or risks that the insured business may face. These may include "bodily injury", "property damage", and "personal and advertising injury". The insurer will only pay for damages resulting from these insured perils and has the right to defend the insured against any lawsuit seeking damages for these perils. However, the insurer has no obligation to defend the insured against lawsuits seeking damages for perils not covered by the policy.

Limits of Insurance:

The policy outlines the maximum amount the insurer will pay for loss or damage in any one occurrence. This limit is shown in the Declarations section of the policy. The policy also specifies limits for specific types of property, such as outdoor signs attached to buildings, and additional coverages like fire department service charges, pollutant clean-up and removal, increased cost of construction, business income from dependent properties, electronic data, and interruption of computer operations.

Other Policy Terms and Provisions:

The policy includes terms regarding other insurance, deductibles, and special coverage limitations. If there is other insurance covering the same loss or damage, the insurer will only pay for the amount of covered loss or damage in excess of the amount due from the other insurance. The policy also outlines the deductible, which is the amount the insured must pay before the insurer is obligated to pay a covered claim. 

Furthermore, the policy includes conditions for property loss, which set forth the duties and obligations of the insured and the insurer throughout the claims process. The insured must strictly comply with these conditions, as a violation may void coverage. 

In summary, businesses must adhere to all these terms and provisions to maintain their coverage under the Business Owner Policy.

---

Requirement 2:
Businesses must comply with the dollar limitations on annual gross sales and contractor payroll as per the policy.

Explanation:
This requirement is mandatory for all businesses applying for the Business Owner Policies. The policy sets specific dollar limitations on the annual gross sales and contractor payroll. The business must adhere to these limits to be eligible for coverage. The dollar limitations are set to manage the risk exposure of the insurer. 

For example, contractors are subject to additional eligibility requirements such as no more than $300,000 of annual payroll, no exterior work at a height of over three stories, and the total cost of subcontracted work cannot exceed more than 10% of the contractor’s total annual gross sales. 

The policy also has specific exclusions such as general contractors and contractors who use cranes in their operations are not eligible for the Businessowners Program. 

The policy also has specific dollar limits for different types of property such as $2,500 for jewelry, watches, and other precious items, and $2,500 for patterns, dies, molds, and forms. 

The policy also has specific time limits for coverage of business income loss and ordinary payroll expenses. 

The policy also has specific endorsements that allow for modifications of coverage such as the Business Income, Extra Expense and Related Coverages Limit of Insurance endorsement and the Discretionary Payroll Expense endorsement. 

The policy also has specific limitations on coverage for loss or damage of property caused by certain perils such as explosion of steam boilers, steam pipes, steam engines, or steam turbines. 

The policy has undergone several revisions over the years to address the growing and ever-expanding needs of businesses. The most recent edition maintains the same dollar limitations on annual gross sales and contractor payroll as the previous edition, but includes a wide range of revisions to address the growing and ever-expanding needs of businesses. 

In conclusion, businesses must comply with the dollar limitations on annual gross sales and contractor payroll as per the policy to be eligible for coverage. This requirement is mandatory and non-negotiable.

Requirement 3. Liability coverage applies to businesses operating in multiple countries, based on where the liability is determined.

Guidelines:

This requirement is mandatory for businesses operating across multiple countries. The liability coverage is determined based on the location where the liability is established. For instance, if a business owner manufactures a product in the United States and sells it in Europe, the liability coverage would apply if the business owner’s liability is determined in a lawsuit filed in the United States.

The Businessowners policy includes two primary coverages: business liability and medical expenses. Business liability covers sums the insured is legally obligated to pay due to bodily injury or property damage. It is typically triggered by an allegation of a negligent act upon the part of an insured. The business liability coverage also provides a legal defense. Medical expense coverage pays third parties for their medical expenses incurred at the insured premises or arising out of the insured’s operations resulting from an accident, regardless of fault.

The coverage territory includes the United States (including its territories and possessions), Puerto Rico, and Canada, and international waters or airspace between these locations. It provides worldwide coverage if the injury or damage arises out of goods or products made or sold by the business owner in that territory, or the activities of a person who is away from the defined territory for a short time on business.

Contractual liability coverage applies only to bodily injury or property damage claims arising after the execution of the agreement or contract. Coverage does not apply to claims arising prior to the execution of the contract.

Management liability coverage insures the wrongful acts of directors and officers in their capacity as directors and officers. Association reimbursement coverage pays on behalf of the association for any loss the association has indemnified an insured person.

If there is other insurance covering the same loss or damage, the insurer will pay only for the amount of covered loss or damage in excess of the amount due from other insurance, whether the business owner can collect on it or not. If the other insurance permits contribution by equal shares, each insurer contributes equally until it has paid its applicable limit of insurance or none of the loss remains, whichever occurs first. If the other insurance does not permit contribution by equal shares, the policy will contribute by limits. Under contribution by limits, each insurer’s share is based on the ratio of its applicable limit of insurance to the total of all applicable limits of all insurers. In any event, the most the insurer will pay is the applicable limit of insurance. Business liability coverage is considered excess over any other insurance that insures for direct physical loss or damage, such as property insurance.

---

Requirement 4: The insurer has the right to inspect the business owner’s premises or operations at any time and provide the business owner with reports on conditions at the premises.

Explanation: This requirement is mandatory and is a standard part of most business owner policies. The insurer reserves the right to conduct inspections and surveys of the business owner's premises or operations at any time. The purpose of these inspections is to assess the conditions of the premises and to determine the level of risk associated with insuring the business. The insurer may provide the business owner with reports on the conditions found during these inspections and may recommend changes to improve safety or reduce risk.

The inspections, surveys, reports, or recommendations provided by the insurer are not safety inspections and are solely related to insurability and the premiums to be charged. They do not replace the business owner's responsibility to comply with safety regulations and laws. 

This requirement also extends to any organizations used by the insurer for the purpose of conducting these inspections. If an insurer's inspector fails to disclose a violation of a safety code during an inspection, neither the insurer nor the inspector is responsible for any injury, damages, or costs incurred as a result of the violation.

The insurer also has the right to inspect any damaged property as often as reasonably required in order to fully assess the extent of the loss or damage. The insurer may also examine and copy the business owner’s books and records as needed.

The business owner is required to cooperate with the insurer in the investigation or settlement of the claim or defense against a lawsuit. This may involve authorizing the insurer to obtain records and other information, providing a signed, sworn proof of loss statement, and assisting the insurer in enforcing any rights against any person or organization that may be liable to the insured. 

The business owner is not permitted to make a payment, assume any obligation, or incur any expense related to a claim without the insurer’s consent, except for first aid expenses. 

The insurer agrees to pay medical expenses for bodily injury caused by an accident on the named insured’s premises or during the named insured’s operations, provided certain conditions are met. 

The business owner must give prompt notice to the insurer of any loss or damage and provide a description of how, when, and where the loss or damage occurred. The business owner must also cooperate with the insurer in its attempts to recover any payments made under the policy.

---

Requirement:
5. The insurer can recommend changes based on inspections, surveys, reports, or recommendations, which relate only to insurability and the premiums to be charged.

Explanation:
The insurer reserves the right to conduct inspections, surveys, or generate reports on the business owner's premises or operations at any time. Based on these assessments, the insurer may provide the business owner with reports on the conditions found and recommend changes. These inspections, surveys, reports, or recommendations are solely for the purpose of determining insurability and the premiums to be charged. They are not safety inspections. 

This condition applies not only to the insurer but also to organizations used by the insurer. For instance, if an insurer’s inspector fails to disclose a violation of a safety code, neither the insurer nor its inspector is held responsible for injury, damages, or costs incurred due to the violation.

The insurer is not obligated to make any inspections, surveys, reports or recommendations. Any such actions undertaken are only related to insurability and the premiums to be charged. The insurer does not undertake to perform the duty of any person or organization to provide for the health or safety of workers or the public. And the insurer does not warrant that conditions are safe or healthful, or comply with laws, regulations, codes or standards.

Categorization: 
This requirement is mandatory. The insurer has the right to inspect the business owner’s premises or operations at any time and provide the business owner with reports on conditions at the premises and recommend changes. These inspections, surveys, reports, or recommendations relate only to insurability and the premiums to be charged.

---

Requirement:
6. The insurer is not responsible for injury, damages, or costs incurred because of a violation of a safety code not disclosed by the insurer’s inspector.

Explanation:
This requirement stipulates that the insurer is not liable for any injury, damages, or costs that may arise due to a violation of a safety code that was not disclosed by the insurer's inspector. This means that if the insurer's inspector fails to identify a violation of a safety code during an inspection, the insurer cannot be held responsible for any subsequent injury, damages, or costs that occur as a result of this violation.

Categorization:
This requirement is mandatory. It is essential to clarify the insurer's liability and protect the insurer against claims that may arise due to undisclosed safety code violations.

Guidelines:
1. The insurer reserves the right to conduct inspections and surveys, provide reports on the conditions found, and recommend changes. These activities are not obligatory and are only related to insurability and the determination of premiums. They do not constitute safety inspections and do not guarantee that conditions are safe, healthful, or in compliance with laws, regulations, codes, or standards.
2. These conditions apply to the insurer and any organization used by the insurer for insurance inspections, surveys, reports, or recommendations.
3. The insurer is not responsible for any injury, damages, or costs incurred due to a safety code violation not disclosed by the insurer's inspector.
4. Exceptions to these conditions may apply in cases where inspections, surveys, reports, or recommendations are made relative to certification under state or municipal statutes, ordinances, or regulations, of boilers, pressure vessels, or elevators.

These guidelines are mandatory and are designed to protect the insurer from liability for undisclosed safety code violations. They also clarify the scope and purpose of any inspections, surveys, reports, or recommendations made by the insurer or its representatives.

Requirement 7: Businesses must adhere to the square footage limitations and gross sales limitations for their specific business type.

This requirement is mandatory for all businesses seeking coverage under the Businessowners Program. The specific limitations vary depending on the type of business and its classification. 

Here are the guidelines for some specific types of businesses:

1. Places of Worship: They must not exceed 7,500 square feet in total floor area. Places of worship that offer childcare, event center, or full kitchens are not eligible.

2. Restaurants: Only certain types of restaurants are eligible for coverage, including limited cooking restaurants. These are restaurants where food is prepared cold or cooked using appliances that do not emit smoke or grease-laden vapors.

3. Contractors, Restaurants, Convenience Stores with Gasoline Pumps, and Laundries and Dry Cleaners: These businesses became eligible in 2002 with an increase in square footage and gross annual sales limits. The square footage limit was increased from 15,000 to 25,000 square feet and the gross sales limit was increased from $2 to $3 million per location.

4. Fitness Studios: These must not exceed 7,500 square feet in total floor area. Fitness studios that offer childcare or teach contact or combat type studios are not eligible.

5. Wine Bars: These have additional eligibility requirements including a maximum of 7,500 square feet in total floor area and a seating capacity of no more than 75. Sales of alcohol other than wine must be limited to 10% or less of total sales.

6. Hotels, Motels, and Inns: These are eligible for coverage under the Businessowners Program. However, buildings with exterior access room entry cannot exceed three stories in height.

7. Offices: Buildings occupied principally for office purposes each of which does not exceed six stories in height or 100,000 square feet in total floor area are eligible for coverage. 

Please note that these are just a few examples and the specific limitations for each business type can be found in the Businessowners Classification Table Section of the manual.

Requirement:
8. Businesses must comply with the per occurrence, per location deductible application.

Category: Mandatory

Explanation:

This requirement mandates that businesses must adhere to the deductible application that applies per occurrence and per location. The deductible refers to the amount that the insured business must absorb before the insurer is obligated to pay a covered claim. 

For instance, if one occurrence results in loss or damage at more than one location, the deductible will apply separately to loss or damage at each location that has sustained loss or damage. This deductible is applied up to the applicable Limit of Insurance of Section I – Property. 

Businessowners policies generally have a standard $500 deductible applicable to property losses and may have a second deductible applicable to Optional Coverages. The insurer will pay for loss or damage after the deductible amount is exceeded up to the limits of insurance indicated in the declarations. 

This is a per occurrence deductible, meaning that only one deductible applies per occurrence regardless of how many types of property are damaged. The deductible applies to all property coverages unless an optional coverage is applied only to the building or structure. 

This requirement is mandatory and is designed to manage the risk of the insurer and to ensure that the insured business has a financial stake in the prevention of losses. 

In the event of a loss, the deductible amount must be met before the insurer will make a payment. This requirement is crucial in maintaining the financial stability of the insurance company and ensuring that businesses are responsible for a portion of their losses. 

The deductible amount and the application of the deductible can have a significant impact on the overall cost of the insurance policy and the amount of a claim payment. Therefore, it is essential for businesses to understand this requirement and to factor it into their risk management strategies.

---

Requirement:
9. All coverages of the policy are subject to the common policy conditions.

Explanation:
The common policy conditions are a set of rules that apply to all coverages of the policy. These conditions are applicable to both property and liability sections of the policy. The common policy conditions are incorporated into the policy itself, specifically in Section III, which is titled Common Policy Conditions (Applicable to Section I – Property and Section II – Liability). 

The common policy conditions include rules for cancellation, where only the first named insured shown in the declarations may cancel the policy by mailing or delivering to the insurer advance written notice of the cancellation. There are also conditions for situations where two or more of the policy’s coverages apply to the same loss or damage, in which case the insurer will not pay more than the actual amount of the loss or damage. 

Other conditions include Liberalization, where if the insurer adopts any revision that would broaden the coverage under the policy without additional premium within 45 days prior to or during the policy period, the broadened coverage will immediately apply to the policy. 

Property Loss Conditions are also part of the common policy conditions, setting forth the duties and obligations of the named insured and the insurer throughout the claims process. They address how property claims will be settled at the time of loss, including how disagreements will be arbitrated. 

Categorization:
This requirement is mandatory. All coverages of the policy are subject to these common policy conditions, and they form a fundamental part of the policy.

**Requirement 10: Policy terms or conditions can be amended or waived only by use of an endorsement issued by the insurer and made a part of the policy.**

**Category: Mandatory**

**Explanation:**

This requirement is a critical part of the underwriting policy for Business Owner Policies. It stipulates that any changes to the policy terms or conditions can only be made through an endorsement issued by the insurer and included as part of the policy. This is a mandatory requirement, ensuring that all changes are officially documented and agreed upon by both parties.

The first named insured, as shown in the policy declarations, is the only party authorized to request changes to the policy terms, and only with the insurer's consent. This means that the insurer has the final authority in determining if certain requests for changes will be approved and effective.

An endorsement is often used when the named insured has a close business relationship with a third party listed in the endorsement schedule. For example, the "Waiver Of Transfer Of Rights Of Recovery Against Others To Us (Waiver Of Subrogation)" endorsement provides an automatic waiver of subrogation on a blanket basis to the extent that the insured has waived its right of recovery in a written contract.

Additional insured endorsements can be used to add other individuals or entities as insureds, addressing the individual needs of the business owner. Examples of these endorsements include "Additional Insured – Automatic Status For Designated Operations" and "Additional Insured – Building Owner".

In the event of the death of the named insured, the rights and duties under the policy will be transferred to the legal representative of the named insured, as long as they act within the scope of those duties.

Finally, the policy prohibits the business owner from transferring their rights and duties under the policy to another party without the prior written consent of the insurer. This ensures that all parties involved in the policy are aware of and agree to any changes.

---

Requirement:
11. Businesses must not engage in concealment, misrepresentation, or fraud in relation to their insurance policy.

Category: Mandatory

Explanation:
This requirement is a fundamental aspect of any insurance policy. It stipulates that businesses must not engage in any form of fraudulent activity, including concealment, misrepresentation, or outright fraud, in relation to their insurance policy. 

The policy is voided in any case of fraud by the insured party as it relates to the policy at any given time. It is also voided if the insured party, or any other insured, intentionally conceals or misrepresents a material fact concerning the policy, the covered property, their interest in the covered property, or a claim under the policy.

The insurer has the right to void the policy at any time in the case of fraud or in the event the insured has intentionally concealed or misrepresented a material fact. A material fact is defined as one that the insurer relies upon when issuing the policy.

For example, if a business owner indicates on his insurance application that his building is twenty years old when in fact it is thirty years old, this could be considered a material misrepresentation. If the insurer finds this discrepancy to be intentional and material to the risk, the policy could be voided.

The insured party is also required to cooperate with the insurer in the investigation or settlement of a claim. This includes not avoiding answering questions or assisting in the claims process. Furthermore, the insured party is required to resume all or part of their operations as quickly as possible following a claim.

In order to verify the amount of loss or damage, the insured party must keep accurate records of all money and securities kept on the insured premises. The insurer will not pay for loss or damage resulting from any dishonest or criminal act committed by the insured party or any of their partners or members, whether acting alone or in collusion with other persons. 

If there is other insurance covering the same loss or damage, the insurer will only pay for the amount of covered loss or damage in excess of the amount due from that other insurance.

## Accounting & Financial Services

### Appetite Guidelines

Based on the provided underwriting guidelines, the following appetite guidelines for the business type: Accounting & Financial Services can be determined:

Acceptable:
1. Preparing, approving or failing to prepare or approve maps, drawings, opinions, reports, surveys, change orders, designs or specifications: These services can be acceptable as they are professional services but may carry a higher risk than legal or accounting services due to the potential for errors and omissions.
2. Supervisory, inspection or engineering services: These services are acceptable as they are professional services but may carry a higher risk due to the potential for errors and omissions.

Declined:
1. Medical, surgical, dental, X-ray or nursing services treatment, advice or instruction: These services are declined as they carry a high risk due to potential malpractice claims.
2. Any health or therapeutic service treatment, advice or instruction: These services are declined as they carry a high risk due to potential malpractice claims.
3. Any service, treatment, advice or instruction for the purpose of appearance or skin enhancement, hair removal or replacement or personal grooming: These services are declined as they carry a high risk due to potential claims related to unsatisfactory results or injury.
4. Optometry or optical or hearing aid services including the prescribing, preparation, fitting, demonstration or distribution of ophthalmic lenses and similar products or hearing aid devices: These services are declined as they carry a high risk due to potential malpractice claims.
5. Body piercing services: These services are declined as they carry a high risk due to potential claims related to unsatisfactory results or injury.
6. Services in the practice of pharmacy: These services are declined as they carry a high risk due to potential malpractice claims.

Note: These guidelines are based on the provided underwriting guidelines and may vary depending on the specific underwriting guidelines of the insurance company.

### Specific Restrictions

Based on the provided underwriting guidelines, the following restrictions apply to insuring businesses in the Accounting & Financial Services sector:

Mandatory Restrictions:
1. The business must fall under the category of legal, accounting, or advertising services as per the professional service categories listed. This is crucial as professional services not listed may not be covered.
2. The business must not engage in any activities that fall under the categories of medical, surgical, dental, X-ray, nursing, health or therapeutic services, appearance or skin enhancement, hair removal or replacement, personal grooming, optometry or optical or hearing aid services, body piercing services, and services in the practice of pharmacy. These are not covered under the policy.

Preferences (Strongly Recommended):
1. It is strongly recommended that the business does not engage in preparing, approving, or failing to prepare or approve maps, drawings, opinions, reports, surveys, change orders, designs, or specifications. This is not a mandatory restriction but could potentially lead to issues with the policy.
2. It is also recommended that the business does not offer supervisory, inspection, or engineering services. While not a deal-breaker, this could complicate the underwriting process.

Please note that these restrictions are based on the provided underwriting guidelines and may vary depending on the specific insurance provider and policy.

## Actuarial & Appraisal Services

### Appetite Guidelines

Based on the underwriting guidelines provided, the appetite guidelines for the business type: Actuarial & Appraisal Services could be as follows:

Preferred:
- Office only businesses: These businesses typically have lower risk as they do not involve manufacturing or retail sales. They are primarily service-based and do not involve the sale of products which could potentially be high-risk.
- Businesses that provide legal, accounting, or advertising services: These are considered lower risk as they are professional services that do not involve the sale of products or the provision of potentially risky services such as medical or surgical services.

Acceptable:
- Businesses that provide supervisory, inspection, or engineering services: While these services may carry some risk, they are generally acceptable as they are professional services that are necessary for many industries.
- Businesses that provide optometry or optical services, including the prescribing, preparation, fitting, demonstration, or distribution of ophthalmic lenses and similar products: These services carry some risk due to the potential for errors in prescription or fitting, but are generally acceptable due to the professional nature of the services.

Declined:
- Businesses that provide medical, surgical, dental, X-ray or nursing services treatment, advice or instruction: These services carry a high risk due to the potential for medical malpractice claims.
- Businesses that provide any health or therapeutic service treatment, advice or instruction for the purpose of appearance or skin enhancement, hair removal or replacement, or personal grooming: These services also carry a high risk due to the potential for injury or dissatisfaction with the results.
- Businesses that provide body piercing services: These services carry a high risk due to the potential for injury or infection.
- Businesses that provide services in the practice of pharmacy: These services carry a high risk due to the potential for errors in medication dispensing or advice.

The underwriting guidelines also provide a detailed appraisal process in case of disagreements over the value of the property or the amount of loss. The process involves the selection of impartial appraisers and an umpire, and a decision agreed to by any two will be binding. However, the insurer retains the right to deny the claim even after the appraisal process, for example, in case of fraudulent claims. The guidelines also clarify that the insured cannot abandon property to the insurer and claim a total loss. The insurer also reserves the right to make inspections and surveys at any time, but is not obligated to do so.

### Specific Restrictions

Mandatory Restrictions:

1. Appraisal Process: If there is disagreement on the value of the property or the amount of loss, either party may demand an appraisal in writing. Each party selects a competent and impartial appraiser, who then select an umpire. If the appraisers cannot agree, a judge in the applicable jurisdiction is asked to choose the umpire. Each appraiser will then separately issue a valuation of the loss. If the two appraisers cannot agree, the umpire will step in. A decision of any two is binding. Each party pays for its own appraiser, and other costs are shared equally. The insurer retains the right to deny the claim regardless of the appraisal outcome, for example, if the insurer discovered that the claim was fraudulent during the appraisal process.

2. No Abandonment: The business owner cannot abandon property to the insurer and claim a total loss. If property is damaged but repairable, the insured is prohibited from abandoning the property to the insurance company and demanding that the company replace all of it.

3. Inspections and Surveys: The insurer has the right to make inspections and surveys at any time, give reports on the conditions found, and recommend changes. However, the insurer is not obligated to make any inspections, surveys, reports or recommendations.

4. Professional Services: The policy does not cover professional services not listed in the guidelines. These include legal, accounting, advertising, medical, surgical, dental, X-ray, nursing, health or therapeutic, appearance or skin enhancement, hair removal or replacement, personal grooming, optometry or optical or hearing aid, body piercing, and pharmacy services.

Preferences (Strongly Recommended):

1. Compliance with Recommendations: While the insurer is not obligated to make inspections, surveys, reports, or recommendations, it is strongly recommended that the insured comply with any recommendations made to ensure insurability and appropriate premiums.

2. Avoidance of Fraudulent Claims: While not explicitly stated, it is strongly recommended that insured parties avoid fraudulent claims, as the insurer retains the right to deny the claim if fraud is discovered during the appraisal process.

## Adult Day Care

### Appetite Guidelines

Based on the underwriting guidelines provided, the appetite guidelines for the business type: Adult Day Care could be as follows:

Preferred:
- Adult Day Care facilities that do not have bar operations or serve alcohol. The guidelines suggest that businesses with alcohol sales, particularly those that allow consumption without full table service, are less desirable. Hence, an Adult Day Care facility without alcohol would be preferred.
- Facilities that do not provide transportation for individuals who may be under the influence of alcohol. The guidelines indicate a reduction in coverage for claims related to negligent supervision of employees handling alcohol or failure to provide transportation for intoxicated individuals.

Acceptable:
- Adult Day Care facilities that have incidental music, such as piano playing. The guidelines suggest that establishments providing such entertainment are eligible.
- Facilities that allow customers to bring their own alcoholic beverages (BYO) onto the premises for consumption. The guidelines state that this action will not be considered to be in the business of selling alcohol, making it an acceptable risk.

Declined:
- Adult Day Care facilities that operate as bars during hours when full table service is not available. The guidelines specifically state that bar operations for the sole purpose of consuming alcoholic beverages are not permitted.
- Facilities that are involved in full scale auto dealership operations. The guidelines indicate that such businesses are ineligible under the Businessowner Program and should be insured under the Commercial Auto Policy’s auto dealers coverage form.
- Adult Day Care facilities that exceed 7,500 square feet in total floor area. The guidelines suggest that larger establishments, such as brewpubs, have additional eligibility requirements.

### Specific Restrictions

Based on the underwriting guidelines provided, the following restrictions could apply to insuring businesses of the type: Adult Day Care. 

Mandatory:
1. The business must not allow bar operations during hours when full table service is not also available. Bar operations for the sole purpose of consuming alcoholic beverages are not permitted.
2. The business must not permit a person to bring alcoholic beverages onto the business owner’s premises for consumption, whether or not a fee is charged or a license is required for such activity.
3. The business must not provide employment, training, or monitoring of others by an insured or providing or failing to provide transportation with respect to any person that may be under the influence of alcohol.
4. The business must not be involved in full scale auto dealership operations (either franchised or nonfranchised dealerships) that sell autos and also provide ancillary auto services (auto repair, auto service, auto detailing, etc.).
5. The business must not exceed 7,500 square feet in total floor area.

Preferences (strongly recommended):
1. It is recommended that the business does not have any business personal property in use at the described premises for more than ninety consecutive days. No coverage applies to business personal property even if the business personal property is placed in the storage unit for less than ninety days. This coverage extension is subject to a $10,000 limit of insurance with higher dollar amounts available.
2. It is recommended that the business does not allow incidental music, such as piano playing, provided by the establishment.
3. It is recommended that the business does not operate as a brewpub, which primarily manufactures beer, ale or malt liquor alcoholic beverages and sells such products on a retail basis for consumption on their premises along with appetizers or meals.

Please note, these guidelines also provide coverage to an auto that is left in the insured’s care custody and control when the insured is attending or operating the auto at or temporarily away from the premises shown in the schedule. This endorsement amends the liability coverage to provide limited coverage for newly acquired or formed organizations. The Businessowners Program includes over one hundred new and revised policy endorsements, many of which were designed to complement ISO’s commercial property, liability, auto and crime forms in its Commercial Package Policy program. These most recent revisions and enhancements provide insurance producers and underwriters with the necessary tools to meet the expanding needs of the business owner’s market.

## Advertising Agencies

### Appetite Guidelines

Preferred: 
- Advertising agencies that operate in an office-only environment. These businesses are less likely to have physical risks associated with them, such as those found in manufacturing or retail environments. 
- Agencies that do not make claims about the quality or performance of their products or services in their advertisements. This reduces the risk of personal and advertising injury claims related to false advertising. 

Acceptable: 
- Advertising agencies that design or determine the content of websites for others. While there is a risk of personal and advertising injury claims related to the content they produce, coverage is granted for false arrest, malicious prosecution, and invasion of privacy. 
- Agencies that place frames, borders, or links, or advertising, for you or others anywhere on the Internet. This activity is not considered the business of advertising, broadcasting, publishing or telecasting, reducing the risk of personal and advertising injury claims.

Declined: 
- Advertising agencies that infringe on copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret or other intellectual property rights. This exclusion eliminates coverage for liability arising out of infringement of these rights, making these businesses a higher risk. 
- Agencies that make claims about the quality or performance of their products or services in their advertisements that do not conform to the actual performance or quality. This increases the risk of personal and advertising injury claims related to false advertising.

### Specific Restrictions

Mandatory Restrictions:
1. The policy excludes coverage for personal or advertising injury committed by an insured whose business involves advertising, broadcasting, publishing, or telecasting, as well as designing or determining content of websites for others, or being an Internet search, access, content or service provider. Exceptions to this exclusion include false arrest, malicious prosecution, and invasion of privacy.
2. Coverage is excluded for personal and advertising injury arising out of the failure of goods, products or services to conform with any statement of quality or performance made in your advertisement. If a product does not deliver as advertised, coverage would be excluded.
3. The policy excludes coverage for liability arising out of infringement of copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret, or other intellectual property rights. However, this does not apply to personal and advertising injury arising out of other intellectual property rights that involve the use of another’s advertising idea in the insured’s advertisement.

Preferences (Strongly Recommended):
1. It is recommended that advertising agencies ensure their advertisements do not infringe on another's copyright, trade dress, or slogan. While coverage is granted for infringement in the insured’s advertisement, it is still best practice to avoid such situations.
2. It is advised that advertising agencies be careful with their claims in advertisements. If a product or service does not meet the advertised claims, coverage would be excluded. Therefore, it is best to ensure all claims can be met to avoid potential issues.
3. It is recommended that advertising agencies avoid activities that could lead to personal or advertising injury, such as false arrest, malicious prosecution, and invasion of privacy. While coverage is granted for these under certain circumstances, avoiding these situations is best practice.

## Alarm System Installation

### Appetite Guidelines

Preferred: 
- Office-only businesses: These businesses typically have a lower risk of theft or burglary, and are expected to maintain their alarm systems in good working order as per the endorsement conditions. 
- Retail businesses excluding high-risk products: These businesses are less likely to be targeted for theft, reducing the risk of alarm system failure or misuse. They are expected to maintain their alarm systems in good working order and comply with all endorsement conditions.

Acceptable: 
- Office and Manufacturing businesses: While these businesses may have a higher risk due to the presence of valuable machinery or equipment, they are still acceptable as long as they maintain their alarm systems properly and comply with all endorsement conditions. 
- Retail businesses including products: These businesses may have a higher risk of theft, but as long as they maintain their alarm systems and comply with all endorsement conditions, they are still acceptable. 

Declined: 
- Businesses with heavy alcohol sales: These businesses have a higher risk of theft and burglary, and may have a higher likelihood of alarm system misuse or failure. 
- Businesses that fail to maintain their alarm systems in good working order, or fail to comply with endorsement conditions: These businesses present a high risk to the insurer, as they may result in theft and burglary losses that are not covered by the policy. 

The businesses are required to maintain the protective safeguard system as indicated in the endorsement in complete working order. The insured is required to notify the insurer within forty-eight hours if the system is not functioning and the protective safeguard system must be in the “on” position during all nonworking hours and whenever the premises are not occupied. Failure to comply with the endorsement conditions can result in the denial of a theft and burglary losses and/or the suspension of coverage.

Preferences (Strongly Recommended):

1. The 2024 edition introduced the requirement that safeguard systems must be maintained in the “on” position at all times. This explicit requirement for active engagement of the protective safeguard system represents a reduction in coverage.

2. The insured’s requirement to carry insurance equal to 80 percent of the value of the property is eliminated.

3. The cost of recharging or replacing the insured’s fire extinguisher system (including hydrostatic testing) if the system is discharged within 1,000 feet of the described premises is covered.

## Antique & Collectible Stores

### Appetite Guidelines

- Antique & Collectible Stores with retail excluding high-risk products. Reasoning: High-risk products may include items that are extremely valuable or rare, increasing the potential for high claim amounts. 

Acceptable: 
- Antique & Collectible Stores with retail including products. Reasoning: Although this includes the sale of products, the risk is still manageable as the items are settled at actual cash value, not at replacement cost.
- Antique & Collectible Stores with alcohol sales below 25%. Reasoning: While alcohol sales can introduce additional risks such as liability issues, if it makes up a small portion of the business, it can still be acceptable.

Declined:

- Antique & Collectible Stores with manufacturing operations. Reasoning: Manufacturing can introduce additional risks, including potential damage to valuable items and increased liability issues.

1. The antique and collectible items such as manuscripts, works of art, antiques, rare articles including etchings, pictures, statuary, marble, bronzes, porcelain, and bric-a-brac are settled at actual cash value and not at replacement cost. This means the insurance coverage will only pay out the depreciated value of the items, not the cost to replace them with new items.
2. If the antique store is also engaged in on-site repair, it should be classified as retail, unless there is a specific repair classification in the Businessowners Classification Manual. 
3. If the antique store has related off-site repair, it must make up no more than 25% of total annual sales to be eligible for insurance coverage.

## Architectural Services

### Appetite Guidelines

Preferred: 
- Architectural Services operating from an office-only location. Reasoning: The underwriting guidelines do not mention any restrictions or additional requirements for professional services operating from an office-only location. 

Acceptable: 
- Architectural Services that also include some form of retail, excluding high-risk products. Reasoning: The guidelines allow for retail risks under the Businessowners program. However, high-risk products are not specified in the guidelines, so it would be safer to exclude them.

Declined: 
- Architectural Services that sell alcohol. Reasoning: The guidelines do not mention alcohol sales in relation to professional services, and it would be unusual for an architectural service to sell alcohol. It's safer to decline this category to avoid potential risks.

- Businesses involved in the sale of alcohol: The guidelines do not specifically mention these businesses, but based on the examples provided, businesses with heavy alcohol consumption are generally declined.

Note: Coverage for over-the-road land motor vehicle exposures may be covered by a commercial auto policy. Limited coverage (i.e., liability only) for automobile exposures is available by adding the Hired Auto and Non-Owned Auto Liability (BP 04 04) endorsement to the policy. The term auto does not include mobile equipment.

### Specific Restrictions

Mandatory Restrictions:
1. Full scale auto dealership operations that sell autos and also provide ancillary auto services are ineligible under the Businessowner Program. They may be insured under the Commercial Auto Policy’s auto dealers coverage form.
2. There is an added exclusion barring coverage for bodily injury or property damage arising out of a customer’s auto when used in any professional or organized racing, demolition or stunt contest or activity.
3. The term auto does not include mobile equipment. Mobile equipment is defined separately and includes specific types of equipment.
4. Coverage for over-the-road land motor vehicle exposures may be covered by a commercial auto policy. Limited coverage (i.e., liability only) for automobile exposures is available by adding the Hired Auto and Non-Owned Auto Liability (BP 04 04) endorsement to the policy.
5. In order for coverage to apply under the policy, a direct physical loss must occur.
6. Land vehicles subject to a compulsory or financial responsibility law or other motor vehicle insurance law are considered “autos.”

Preferences (Strongly Recommended):
1. It is recommended to have the Auto Service Risks (BP 15 98) endorsement, which addresses the specialized needs of auto service risks. This includes increased coverage for storage tanks, fire department service charge, pollution clean-up and removal, money orders and counterfeit money, forgery and alterations, and reward payment and return of stolen property.
2. It is also recommended to have the Auto Service Risks – Canine Exclusion (BP 15 99) and Auto Service Risks – Supplemental Schedule (BP DS 09) endorsements. The former enables excluding an insured’s canine, while the latter permits scheduling higher property limits.
3. Employee’s tools are limited to $10,000 ($1,000 per employee), suggesting it is advisable to not have more than this amount in tools per employee.
4. Outdoor property coverage is increased from $2,500 to $5,000, suggesting it is advisable to not have more than this amount in outdoor property.
5. Lock/repair replacement is $1,000 subject to a $100 deductible, suggesting it is advisable to not have more than this amount in lock/repair replacements.

## Awning Installation

### Appetite Guidelines

Preferred: 
- Office only businesses: These businesses are less likely to have awnings or canopies, which are not covered by the policy in case of windstorm or hail damage. They are also less likely to have outdoor property that could be damaged by specified perils, thus reducing the risk for the insurer. 

Acceptable: 
- Office and Manufacturing: Although these businesses may have awnings or canopies, they are likely to have other types of property that are covered by the policy. 
- Retail including products: While these businesses may have outdoor property that could be damaged by specified perils, the policy does provide some coverage for outdoor property. 
- Businesses selling alcohol below 25%: These businesses may have outdoor property, including awnings and canopies, that could be damaged by specified perils. However, the risk is mitigated by the low percentage of alcohol sales.

Declined: 
- Awning Installation: The policy does not cover damage to awnings or canopies caused by windstorm or hail, which is a significant risk for this type of business. 
- Heavy alcohol consumption businesses: These businesses are likely to have outdoor property, including awnings and canopies, that could be damaged by specified perils. The risk is further increased by the high percentage of alcohol sales. 
- Nightclubs: These businesses are likely to have outdoor property, including awnings and canopies, that could be damaged by specified perils. The risk is further increased by the nature of the business. 

Note: Coverage does apply to damage by windstorm to lawns, trees, shrubs, or plants that are part of a vegetated roof. Also, in order to trigger coverage for interior damage caused by rain, snow, sand, or dust, wind or hail must first cause an opening in the exterior of the building. Coverage is available if a strong gale breaks a glass windowpane and rain damages interior property.

### Specific Restrictions

Mandatory:
1. Damage caused by windstorm or hail to awnings or canopies of fabric or slat construction, including their supports, outside of buildings is not covered. This means that businesses dealing with awning installations should have alternative measures to protect their awnings from windstorm or hail damage.
2. Coverage for interior damage caused by rain, snow, sand, or dust is only applicable if wind or hail first causes an opening in the exterior of the building. This implies that businesses dealing with awning installations should ensure their installations are secure and resistant to wind or hail to prevent such openings.
3. If an awning collapses due to insect damage, weight of people or personal property, or defective materials or methods, no coverage applies. This means that businesses dealing with awning installations should ensure their installations are free from these risks to be eligible for coverage.
4. Coverage for collapse is only applicable if the collapse was caused by a cause of loss listed in the guidelines, the personal property which collapses is inside a building, and is not an awning, gutter, downspout, yard fixture, outdoor swimming pool, pier, wharf, dock, beach or diving platform, retaining wall, a walk, roadway, or other paved surface. This implies that businesses dealing with awning installations should ensure their installations meet these conditions to be eligible for coverage.
5. Coverage for outdoor property is limited to $2,500, unless a higher Limit Of Insurance for Outdoor Property is shown in the Declarations, but not more than $1,000 for any one tree, shrub or plant. This means that businesses dealing with awning installations should ensure their outdoor property values do not exceed these limits to be fully covered.

Preferences:
1. It is strongly recommended that businesses dealing with awning installations extend their insurance coverage to include outdoor fences, antennas, and their lead-in wiring, masts or towers not attached to the buildings, signs, trees, shrubs and plants, including debris removal expense. This is because loss or damage to these items must be caused by or result from any of the following causes of loss: Fire, Lightning, Explosion, Riot or Civil Commotion, or Aircraft.
2. It is also recommended that businesses dealing with awning installations ensure their watercraft (including motors, equipment, and accessories) are not afloat to be eligible for coverage. However, coverage does apply if the watercraft, motors, equipment, and accessories are on a trailer, in storage, or in dry dock.

## Bakeries & Bagel Shops

### Appetite Guidelines

Preferred:
- Bakeries & Bagel Shops that operate as limited cooking restaurants. These businesses are preferred as they prepare foods that are cold or cooked using appliances which do not emit smoke or grease-laden vapors that require an exhaust system. This reduces the risk of fire and related damages. 

Acceptable:
- Bakeries & Bagel Shops that operate as quick service restaurants. These businesses are acceptable as long as they adhere to the additional eligibility requirements such as no more than 7,500 square feet in total floor area, seating capacity no greater than 150, sales of beer or wine only and no greater than 25 percent of total sales, no bar or cocktail lounge, and no seasonal operations. These guidelines help to limit the potential risks associated with larger operations, alcohol sales, and seasonal closures.
- Bakeries & Bagel Shops that operate as full service restaurants. These businesses are acceptable as long as they adhere to the additional eligibility requirements such as no more than 7,500 square feet in total floor area, seating capacity no greater than 150, sales of beer, wine, or liquor no greater than 50 percent of total sales, no seasonal operations, installation and maintenance of an automatic extinguishing system for cooking equipment, no dancing, and no live entertainment other than incidental music. These guidelines help to limit the potential risks associated with larger operations, alcohol sales, and live entertainment.

Declined:
- Bakeries & Bagel Shops that operate as brewpubs. These businesses are declined as they primarily manufacture beer, ale or malt liquor alcoholic beverages and sell such products on a retail basis for consumption on their premises. This increases the risk of alcohol-related incidents and potential damages.
- Bakeries & Bagel Shops that exceed the size, seating capacity, alcohol sales, and entertainment guidelines listed in the acceptable category. These businesses are declined as they present higher risks due to larger operations, higher alcohol sales, and live entertainment. Additionally, businesses with bar operations during hours when full table service is not also available are declined as they increase the risk of alcohol-related incidents.

### Specific Restrictions

Mandatory Restrictions for Bakeries & Bagel Shops:

1. The establishment must not exceed 7,500 square feet in total floor area.
2. The seating capacity must not be greater than 150.
3. Sales of beer, wine, or liquor must not exceed 50 percent of total sales.
4. Catering services (i.e., serving of food away from the insured’s premises) must not exceed 10 percent of total sales.
5. The establishment must not have seasonal operations (i.e., closed for more than thirty consecutive days).
6. The establishment must install and maintain an automatic extinguishing system for cooking equipment equivalent to that which is recommended by NFPA Standard #96.
7. The establishment must not have dancing or live entertainment (including karaoke) other than incidental music, such as piano playing.
8. The establishment must not have bar operations during hours when full table service is not also available; bar operations for the sole purpose of consuming alcoholic beverages are not permitted.

Preferences (Strongly Recommended) for Bakeries & Bagel Shops:

1. It is recommended that the establishment does not have more than 10% of direct retail sales.
2. It is recommended that the establishment does not directly import products for retail sale.
3. It is recommended that the establishment does not have a bar or cocktail lounge.
4. It is recommended that the establishment does not offer buffet services.
5. It is recommended that the establishment does not serve alcoholic beverages; if it does, it should only serve beer and wine.
6. It is recommended that the establishment does not have propane or kerosene tank filling operations.

## Banks & Credit Unions

### Appetite Guidelines

Based on the underwriting guidelines provided, the appetite guidelines for Banks & Credit Unions would be as follows:

Preferred:
- Banks and credit unions that have comprehensive coverage for loss or damage to property, including theft, disappearance, and destruction. This is due to the high exposure to such risks inherent in their operations.
- Banks and credit unions that have coverage for defense and fines or penalties related to noncompliance with Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards. This is crucial as these businesses handle a large volume of credit card transactions and are therefore at risk of noncompliance claims.

Acceptable:
- Banks and credit unions that have coverage for short-term pollution events. While these businesses are not typically associated with pollution risks, such coverage would be beneficial in the event of an unexpected incident.
- Banks and credit unions that have a small percentage of direct retail sales (no more than 10%). This is because retail operations can introduce additional risks that may not be adequately covered under a standard businessowners policy.

Declined:
- Banks and credit unions that directly import products for retail sale. This is because such operations can introduce additional risks and complexities that may not be adequately covered under a standard businessowners policy.
- Banks and credit unions that do not have coverage for loss or damage caused by or resulting from the use or alleged use of credit, debit, or other cards. This is a significant risk for these businesses and lack of coverage in this area would be a major concern.

Please note that the 2010 edition of the guidelines eliminated the limitation related to loss of or damage to property that has been transferred to a person outside the described premises on the basis of unauthorized instructions and revised the false pretense exclusion. These changes broadened the coverage. The revision also introduced an exclusion eliminating coverage for loss or damage caused by or resulting from the use or alleged use of credit, debit, charge, access, convenience, identification, stored value, or other cards or the information contained on such cards. The addition of this exclusion reduced the coverage.

### Specific Restrictions

Mandatory Restrictions:

1. Banks and credit unions must set a coverage limit based on their maximum exposure for loss of money and securities. A typical limit would be $10,000.

2. The 2010 edition of the underwriting guidelines eliminated coverage for loss or damage caused by or resulting from the use or alleged use of credit, debit, charge, access, convenience, identification, stored value, or other cards or the information contained on such cards. This is a reduction of coverage that banks and credit unions must adhere to.

3. The 2024 edition of the underwriting guidelines updates the definition of an employee to be consistent with that of the ISO’s Crime program and deletes from coverage an employee benefit plan. This is a reduction in coverage that banks and credit unions must adhere to.

4. Banks and credit unions must provide coverage for loss (fines and penalties) assessed against the insured and defense expenses as a result of a claim taken by a credit card company (such as Visa, MasterCard, or American Express) for noncompliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards.

5. Banks and credit unions are not eligible for coverage if they directly import products for retail sale.

Preferences (Strongly Recommended):

1. It is strongly recommended that banks and credit unions have a fire suppression system in place.

2. It is strongly recommended that banks and credit unions have a pollution exclusion in place to cover a short-term pollution event. Coverage applies if the escape of pollutants begins at an identifiable time and place, ends no later than forty-eight hours after it begins, and is reported to the insurer as soon as practicable, but no later than fourteen days after the end of the incident.

3. It is strongly recommended that banks and credit unions have coverage for loss of money and securities resulting from fraudulent instructions (without the insured’s knowledge and consent) directing a financial institution to transfer or deliver money and securities from the insured’s transfer account. 

4. It is strongly recommended that banks and credit unions do not have more than 10% of direct retail sales.

Preferred:
- Barber & Beauty Salons with professional liability coverage (BP 08 01 and BP 08 09 endorsements) for bodily injury, property damage, and personal and advertising injury arising out of the rendering of or failure to render salon services. This is preferred as it provides comprehensive coverage for the main activities of these businesses.

Acceptable:
- Barber & Beauty Salons offering additional services described in the endorsement schedule, as long as these services fall within the definition of salon services. This is acceptable as it allows for a wider range of services, increasing the business's potential revenue, while still being covered by the professional liability endorsement.
- Barber & Beauty Salons that also sell retail products related to their services. This is acceptable as it provides an additional revenue stream for the business, but may carry a slightly higher risk due to potential product liability issues.

Declined:
- Barber & Beauty Salons that offer services not falling within the definition of salon services or described as an additional service in the endorsement schedule. These are declined as they may carry a higher risk and are not covered by the professional liability endorsement.
- Barber & Beauty Salons that offer removal of hair by electrolysis, hair implanting or transplanting, or the use of any dye or coloring to eyelashes except mascara or eyebrow pencils. These are declined as they are explicitly excluded from the professional liability coverage.
- Barber & Beauty Salons that sell alcohol. This is declined as it introduces additional risks and complications, such as potential liability for alcohol-related incidents, which are not covered under the provided endorsements.

### Specific Restrictions

Mandatory Restrictions for Barber & Beauty Salons:

3. Additional Services: Any additional services not falling within the definition of salon services or described as an additional service in the endorsement schedule are excluded.

Preferences (Strongly Recommended) for Barber & Beauty Salons:

1. Additional Endorsements: While not mandatory, it is strongly recommended that business owners who perform professional services consider additional endorsements to meet their specific needs and to cover potential gaps in their policy’s coverage.

2. Building and Business Personal Property Coverage: It is strongly recommended that Barber & Beauty Salons have building and business personal property coverage.

3. Business Income/Extra Expense Exclusions: It is advisable for Barber & Beauty Salons to consider their business income and extra expense exclusions to ensure they have adequate coverage.

4. Business Personal Property Limits: Seasonal variations in business personal property limits should be considered.

## Bath & Bedding Shops

### Appetite Guidelines

Based on the underwriting guidelines provided, the appetite guidelines for the business type: Bath & Bedding Shops would be as follows:

Preferred:
- Retail excluding high-risk products: Bath & Bedding Shops primarily deal with low-risk products such as linens, towels, and other home goods. These items do not fall into categories such as electronics, drugs, or alcohol, which are typically considered high-risk.
- Office only: If the Bath & Bedding Shop operates solely as a retail space without any manufacturing on-site, it would be preferred. This reduces the risk of accidents or damage related to manufacturing processes.

Acceptable:
- Retail including products: If the Bath & Bedding Shop also sells products like home decor or small electronics, it would still be acceptable. These products do not significantly increase the risk profile of the business.
- Office and Manufacturing: If the Bath & Bedding Shop also has a small-scale manufacturing operation (for example, custom bedding or curtains), it would be acceptable as long as safety measures are in place.

Declined:
- Businesses with alcohol sales: Bath & Bedding Shops that also sell alcohol would be declined. Alcohol sales introduce additional risks, such as potential liability issues, that are not typically associated with this type of retail business.
- Businesses exceeding 10% of direct retail sales online: The guidelines specify that businesses with more than 10% of direct retail sales online are not eligible for coverage under the Businessowners Program.
- Businesses that directly import products for retail sale: The guidelines also state that businesses that directly import products for retail sale are not eligible for coverage.

- Beverage distributors and retailers that do not manufacture alcoholic beverages. According to the underwriting guidelines, coverage is excluded for businesses that manufacture, sell, or distribute alcoholic beverages. However, an exception is made for businesses that sell, serve, or furnish alcoholic beverages at activities described in the schedule. Therefore, beverage distributors and retailers that only sell or serve alcohol (not manufacture) and are described in the schedule would be preferred.
- Wine bars that meet additional eligibility requirements such as no more than 7,500 square feet in total floor area, seating capacity of no more than 75, sales of alcohol other than wine limited to 10% or less of total sales, no bar operations during hours when full table service is not also available, and catering not exceeding 10% of total sales. These requirements limit the risk exposure of the insurer.

Acceptable:
- Brewpubs that meet additional eligibility requirements such as no more than 7,500 square feet in total floor area. Brewpubs primarily manufacture beer, ale, or malt liquor alcoholic beverages and sell such products on a retail basis for consumption on their premises along with appetizers or meals. Although they manufacture alcohol, they are acceptable because they are subject to additional eligibility requirements that limit the risk exposure of the insurer.
- Businesses that permit customers to bring their own alcoholic beverages (BYO) onto the premises for consumption. The underwriting guidelines provide an exception for BYO alcohol at the scheduled premises.

Declined:
- Businesses that manufacture, sell, or distribute alcoholic beverages and are not described in the schedule. The underwriting guidelines exclude coverage for these businesses.
- Businesses that serve or furnish alcoholic beverages for a charge if a liquor license is required and are not described in the schedule. These businesses are also excluded from coverage.
- Businesses that permit any person to bring alcohol on the premises for consumption and are not described in the schedule. These businesses are also excluded from coverage.
- Nightclubs and businesses with heavy alcohol consumption. These businesses are considered high-risk and are therefore declined.

## Bicycle Sales & Service

### Appetite Guidelines

Based on the underwriting guidelines provided, the appetite guidelines for the business type: Bicycle Sales & Service could be as follows:

Preferred:
- Bicycle Sales & Service businesses that operate primarily as retail, excluding high-risk products. These businesses are preferred because they have lower risk exposure as they do not involve high-risk products.
- Businesses that do not directly import products for retail sale. This is preferred as it reduces the risk of product liability claims.
- Businesses that have related off-site repair up to 25% of total annual sales. This is preferred as it shows that the business has diversified income streams, reducing the risk of business interruption.

Acceptable:
- Bicycle Sales & Service businesses that operate as both office and manufacturing. While these businesses have higher risk exposure due to the manufacturing aspect, they are still acceptable as long as they meet other guidelines.
- Businesses that have no more than 10% of direct retail sales. This is acceptable as it reduces the risk of product liability claims.
- Businesses that provide maintenance, repair, replacement or supervision services. These are acceptable as they are part of the normal operations of a Bicycle Sales & Service business.

Declined:
- Businesses that are full-scale auto dealership operations. These are declined as they are ineligible under the Businessowner Program and may be insured under the Commercial Auto Policy’s auto dealers coverage form.
- Bicycle Sales & Service businesses that sell alcohol. These are declined due to the increased risk of liability claims associated with alcohol sales.
- Businesses that conduct operations using mobile equipment and vehicles away from the business owners’ premises. These are declined as the endorsement is not designed for businesses with mobile-only operations.

The response is satisfactory and covers all the necessary points from the underwriting guidelines. The response is clear, accurate, and complete.

1. The business must not engage in any professional or organized racing, demolition, or stunt contest or activity with a customer's auto. This is due to the exclusion barring coverage for bodily injury or property damage arising out of such activities.

4. If the business is engaged in on-site repair, it should be classified as retail, unless there is a specific repair classification in the Businessowners Classification Manual. Related off-site repair up to 25% of total annual sales is eligible.

Preferences (Strongly Recommended):
1. It is recommended that the business has a fire suppression system, similar to restaurants, as this can help mitigate potential damages and losses.
2. The business should consider having a Specified Business Personal Property Temporarily Away From Premises Endorsement, BP 14 79, if it has property exposures beyond the reach of the limited off-premises coverage extension.

## Binderies & Printing Services

### Appetite Guidelines

Preferred: 
- Binderies & Printing Services operating as office only. Reasoning: The underwriting guidelines provide coverage for the insured’s negligent acts, errors, or omissions in providing printing services under Printer’s Errors and Omissions Liability (BP 08 04). However, claims resulting from publishing functions are not covered. 

Acceptable: 
- Binderies & Printing Services operating as office and manufacturing. Reasoning: The guidelines provide coverage for printer’s errors or omissions. However, production errors such as the introduction of foreign matter, addition of wrong ingredient or element, or an inaccurate measurement are excluded. This type of exposure is a business risk. More comprehensive coverage for manufacturing type business exposures is available on stand-alone Manufacturing Errors and Omissions policies.

Declined: 
- Binderies & Printing Services involved in heavy alcohol sales. Reasoning: The underwriting guidelines do not provide any specific coverage for businesses involved in alcohol sales. Therefore, these types of businesses would not be covered under the current guidelines. 
- Binderies & Printing Services involved in retail including high-risk products. Reasoning: The guidelines do not provide any specific coverage for businesses involved in retail including high-risk products. Therefore, these types of businesses would not be covered under the current guidelines.

### Specific Restrictions

Based on the underwriting guidelines provided, the following restrictions apply to insuring businesses of the type: Binderies & Printing Services.

Mandatory:
1. Printer’s Errors and Omissions Liability (BP 08 04): This endorsement provides liability coverage for the insured’s negligent acts, errors, or omissions in providing printing services.

2. Exclusion for Production Errors: This exclusion reinforces that claims related to production errors such as the introduction of foreign matter, addition of wrong ingredient or element, or an inaccurate measurement are not covered. This is a business risk that binderies and printing services must be aware of and manage appropriately.

Preferences (strongly recommended):
1. Terrorism Endorsements: While not mandatory, it is strongly recommended that binderies and printing services consider terrorism endorsements. These were introduced after the enactment of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA) and provide coverage for losses resulting from acts of terrorism.

2. Manufacturing Errors and Omissions policies: More comprehensive coverage for manufacturing type business exposures is available on stand-alone Manufacturing Errors and Omissions policies. While not mandatory, it is strongly recommended that binderies and printing services consider this coverage to ensure they are adequately protected against potential risks and liabilities.

## Boiler & Furnace Installation/Repair

### Appetite Guidelines

Preferred: 
- Boiler & Furnace Installation/Repair businesses that operate from an office only. These businesses pose less risk as they do not have manufacturing operations that could potentially lead to accidents or damages. 
- Businesses that do not manufacture or sell products under their own name. This reduces the risk of product liability claims.

Acceptable: 
- Boiler & Furnace Installation/Repair businesses that operate both an office and manufacturing. While these businesses pose a higher risk than office-only operations, they are still acceptable if they follow safety regulations and guidelines.
- Businesses that manufacture or sell products under their own name. While this increases the risk of product liability claims, it is still acceptable if the products are not high-risk.

Declined: 
- Contractors who engage in demolition, blasting, wrecking, high pressure boiler work or liquid petroleum gas (LPG) work. These activities pose a high risk of accidents and damages.
- Contractors who engage in hazardous material or pollution abatement operations, including but not limited to asbestos, lead and radon. These activities pose a high risk of environmental damage and related claims.
- Contractors who repair, install or service boilers, burglar alarm systems, automatic fire extinguishing systems, elevators, escalators or computers. These activities pose a high risk of accidents and damages.
- Contractors who use cranes in their operations. These activities pose a high risk of accidents and damages.

Mandatory Restrictions:
1. Contractors who repair, install, or service boilers, burglar alarm systems, automatic fire extinguishing systems, elevators, escalators or computers must meet all standards of any statute, ordinance, regulation, or license requirement of any federal, state, or local government that apply to their operations.

Preferences (strongly recommended):
1. It is recommended that the insured maintains heat in the building or structure or drains the equipment and shuts it off if heat is not maintained to prevent damage from freezing.
2. It is recommended to have coverage for equipment breakdown protection for steam boilers and similar equipment as they pose a greater exposure than explosion caused by natural gas, oil, or coal.
3. It is recommended to have coverage for windstorm or hail, but not including frost or cold weather, ice (other than hail), snow or sleet, whether driven by wind or not.

## Bookstores & Magazines

### Appetite Guidelines

Based on the underwriting guidelines provided, the appetite guidelines for the business type: Bookstores & Magazines could be as follows:

Preferred:
- Bookstores and magazines that operate as office-only businesses. These businesses have a lower risk profile as they do not involve manufacturing or direct retail sales, which can increase risk exposure.
- Bookstores and magazines that do not directly import products for retail sale. This reduces the risk of liability issues related to imported goods.

## Bridal Shops

### Appetite Guidelines

Preferred:

These businesses are preferred as they fall under the category of clothing (specialty or formal wear) which is mentioned in the underwriting guidelines. The risk associated with these businesses is relatively low as they do not involve manufacturing or sale of high-risk products.

Acceptable: 
- Bridal Shops that include the sale of products such as miscellaneous gifts or novelties, music or video (pre-recorded), paper or stationery, or shoes. These businesses are acceptable as they are included in the underwriting guidelines, but they carry a slightly higher risk due to the nature of the products they sell.
- Bridal Shops that operate as both office and retail, with no more than 10% of direct retail sales. These businesses are acceptable as they meet the eligibility requirements mentioned in the underwriting guidelines.

Declined: 
- Bridal Shops that directly import products for retail sale. These businesses are declined as they do not meet the eligibility requirements mentioned in the underwriting guidelines.
- Bridal Shops that also operate as restaurants or bars serving alcohol. These businesses are declined as they carry a higher risk due to the sale of alcohol and potential liability issues.
- Bridal Shops that exceed 7,500 square feet in total floor area or have a seating capacity greater than 150. These businesses are declined as they do not meet the eligibility requirements mentioned in the underwriting guidelines.

### Specific Restrictions

Based on the provided underwriting guidelines, the following restrictions could apply to insuring businesses of the type: Bridal Shops.

Mandatory Restrictions:
1. Bridal shops, which fall under the category of clothing (specialty or formal wear), must not have more than 10% of direct retail sales. This is a firm requirement for eligibility under the Businessowners Program.
2. Bridal shops cannot directly import products for retail sale. This is another strict eligibility requirement under the Businessowners Program.

This provides coverage for bodily injury, property damage, and personal and advertising injury arising from these services.

Preferences (Strongly Recommended):
1. While not explicitly stated, it would be advisable for bridal shops to have an automatic fire suppression system in place, similar to the requirement for restaurants. Given that bridal shops deal with high-value, flammable items (wedding dresses), this would be a prudent measure to reduce risk.
2. It would also be beneficial for bridal shops to have burglary coverage, given the high value of the products they sell. This isn't a mandatory requirement, but it would likely be strongly recommended by insurers.
3. If the bridal shop offers any professional services, such as wedding planning or dress alterations, it would be advisable to have appropriate professional liability coverage. This isn't explicitly required in the guidelines, but it would provide protection against claims related to errors or omissions in these services.

### Appetite Guidelines

Based on the underwriting guidelines provided, the appetite guidelines for the business type: Dry Cleaning & Laundry Services could be as follows:

Preferred:
- Dry Cleaning & Laundry Services with office only: These businesses have a lower risk profile as they do not involve manufacturing which can increase the risk of accidents or damages.
- Dry Cleaning & Laundry Services excluding high-risk products: Businesses that do not deal with high-risk products are preferred as they present less liability and potential for claims.

Acceptable:
- Dry Cleaning & Laundry Services with office and manufacturing: While these businesses have a higher risk profile due to the inclusion of manufacturing, they are still acceptable if other risk factors are manageable.
- Dry Cleaning & Laundry Services including products: Businesses that include products can be acceptable, provided the products are not high-risk and the business has adequate safety and risk management procedures in place.

Declined:
- Dry Cleaning & Laundry Services with heavy alcohol usage: Any business in this category that involves heavy alcohol usage would be declined due to the increased risk of accidents, damages, and potential legal issues.
- Dry Cleaning & Laundry Services that are full-scale auto dealership operations: These are ineligible under the Businessowner Program and may be insured under the Commercial Auto Policy’s auto dealers coverage form.

Reasoning:
The underwriting guidelines indicate that businesses with lower risk profiles are preferred. This includes businesses that do not involve manufacturing or high-risk products. Businesses with higher risk profiles, such as those involving manufacturing or products, can still be acceptable if other risk factors are manageable. However, businesses with heavy alcohol usage or that are full-scale auto dealership operations are declined due to the increased risk they present.

### Specific Restrictions

Mandatory Restrictions:

3. The business is recommended to have coverage for up to an additional $25,000 for debris removal expense, for each location, in any one occurrence of physical loss or damage to Covered Property. 

Additional Recommendations:
1. The business should consider an endorsement that provides a reward payment for individuals who provide information leading to an arrest and conviction or return of stolen property. 
2. Coverage should also apply to key and lock replacement for a client in the event residential cleaning services lose the client’s keys or if the keys are stolen.
3. The business should be aware that the 2010 edition deleted the word bacteria from the endorsement to reinforce its intention of not covering claims involving bacterium or other microorganism that may induce physical distress, illness, or disease.

## Embroidery & Custom Apparel

### Appetite Guidelines

Based on the provided underwriting guidelines, the following appetite guidelines can be determined for the business type: Embroidery & Custom Apparel.

Preferred:
- Office only businesses: These businesses are likely to have lower risk as they do not involve manufacturing processes which can increase the risk of accidents or damages.
- Retail excluding high-risk products: As the business involves embroidery and custom apparel, it is unlikely to deal with high-risk products such as drugs, electronics, or heavy machinery. This reduces the risk of liability claims.

Acceptable:
- Office and Manufacturing: While manufacturing can increase risk, it is a necessary part of an embroidery and custom apparel business. As long as safety guidelines are followed, these businesses can be considered acceptable.
- Retail including products: Selling products can increase the risk of liability claims, but as long as the products are not high-risk, these businesses can be considered acceptable.

Declined:
- Businesses with alcohol sales: The sale of alcohol is not related to the business of embroidery and custom apparel and can significantly increase risk, making these businesses unsuitable.
- Businesses that directly import products for retail sale: These businesses have a higher risk due to potential issues with product quality, import regulations, and supply chain disruptions.
- Businesses exceeding 10% of direct retail sales: These businesses may have a higher exposure to risk due to increased customer interactions and potential for product liability claims.

Reasoning: The underwriting guidelines provided focus on the type of business operations (office, retail, manufacturing), the products involved, and the percentage of direct retail sales.

## Fence Installation & Sales

### Appetite Guidelines

Preferred: 
- Office only businesses: The guidelines indicate that coverage can be extended to outdoor property such as fences, antennas, and signs not attached to buildings. This suggests that businesses that operate primarily from an office, without heavy construction or manufacturing activities, would be preferred. This is because they present less risk in terms of potential damage to outdoor property.
- Retail excluding high-risk products: The guidelines mention that retail risks are eligible for coverage under the Businessowners program. However, it doesn't specify what types of products are considered high-risk, so it's safe to assume that retail businesses that don't sell high-risk products would be preferred.

Acceptable: 
- Office and Manufacturing: While the guidelines don't explicitly mention manufacturing businesses, they do provide coverage for materials, equipment, supplies, and temporary structures located on or within 1,000 feet of the described premises. This suggests that businesses with both office and manufacturing operations could be acceptable, as long as their activities don't involve heavy construction or other high-risk activities.
- Retail including products: Retail businesses that sell products could also be acceptable, as long as the products aren't considered high-risk. The guidelines provide coverage for building and business personal property for retail risks.

Declined:

This suggests that businesses involved in these types of activities would be declined.
- Businesses with alcohol sales: The guidelines don't mention alcohol sales, so it's unclear whether businesses that sell alcohol would be covered. However, given the potential risks associated with alcohol consumption, it's possible that these businesses would be declined.
- Tree service or removal contracting work: The guidelines explicitly state that contractors who engage in tree service or removal contracting work are not covered. This suggests that businesses involved in these types of activities would be declined.

### Specific Restrictions

Mandatory Restrictions:

1. This policy extends to cover outdoor fences, antennas (including dish-shaped antennas), their lead-in wiring, masts or towers not attached to the buildings, signs (other than signs attached to buildings), trees, shrubs, and plants (excluding those part of a vegetated roof), including debris removal expense.

## Lighting Fixtures & Supplies

### Appetite Guidelines

Preferred:
- Office only businesses: These businesses are less likely to have heavy machinery and equipment, reducing the risk of damage or accidents. They also typically have less foot traffic, reducing the risk of theft or damage.
- Retail excluding high-risk products: Businesses that do not sell high-risk products have a lower risk of liability claims, making them a preferred risk.
- Businesses without alcohol sales: These businesses have a lower risk of liability claims related to alcohol consumption, making them a preferred risk.

Acceptable:
- Office and Manufacturing businesses: While these businesses have a higher risk due to the presence of machinery and equipment, they are still acceptable if they have proper safety measures in place and their machinery and equipment are permanently installed.
- Retail including products: Retail businesses that sell products have a higher risk of theft or damage, but are still acceptable if they have proper security measures in place and their direct retail sales do not exceed 10%.
- Restaurants selling alcohol below 25%: These businesses have a higher risk due to alcohol sales, but are still acceptable if the percentage of alcohol sales is kept below 25%.

Declined:
- Businesses with heavy alcohol consumption: These businesses have a high risk of liability claims related to alcohol consumption and are therefore declined.
- Businesses directly importing products for retail sale: These businesses have a higher risk due to potential issues with product quality or safety, making them a declined risk.
- Businesses with more than 10% of direct retail sales: These businesses have a higher risk due to the increased likelihood of theft or damage, making them a declined risk.

Note: The above classifications are subject to the fixtures, machinery, and equipment guidelines introduced in the 2024 edition. Businesses should ensure that their Business Personal Property value is increased to reflect the added value of these fixtures, machinery, and equipment.

### Specific Restrictions

Mandatory Restrictions for Lighting Fixtures & Supplies Businesses:

1. The business must clearly distinguish between fixtures and machinery or equipment. Fixtures are items attached to a building that cannot be removed without affecting the value or aesthetics of the structure. Examples of fixtures include intercoms, public address systems, permanently installed blinds, custom drapes, outdoor fixtures such as lights, flag poles, parking stops, mailboxes, and signs. Machinery and equipment, such as built-in scales, pulleys, refrigerated lockers, and air-conditioning or heating equipment, must be “permanently installed.”

2. The business must ensure coverage for personal property owned by the named insured in an apartment, rooms, or maintenance, repair, replacement or supervision provided or done by you or for you to determine, rectify or test for any potential or actual problem that may develop.

3. The business must provide coverage for materials, equipment, supplies, and temporary structures located on or within 1,000 feet of the described premises. This coverage applies only to materials slated for use with existing buildings and structures. If the insured is constructing a new building or structure, this coverage does not apply.

4. The business must not have more than 10% of direct retail sales and may not directly import products for retail sale.

Preferences (Strongly Recommended) for Lighting Fixtures & Supplies Businesses:

1. It is recommended that the business personal property should be increased to reflect the added value or a coinsurance problem may arise.

2. It is recommended that the business owner should secure a separate policy to cover the exposure if they are constructing a new building or structure.

3. It is recommended that the business should consider optional coverage for equipment breakdown. This covers the cost to repair or replace mechanical and electrical equipment that breaks down (e.g., air conditioning and refrigeration equipment, copiers, outdoor signs).

4. It is recommended that the insured may elect a fixed dollar deductible applicable to this optional coverage. In the event no deductible is chosen, the coverage form’s deductible applies.

## Locksmiths

### Appetite Guidelines

Based on the underwriting guidelines provided, the appetite guidelines for the business type: Locksmiths could be as follows:

Preferred:
- Office only locksmiths: These businesses have less risk as they do not engage in manufacturing or selling products under their own name, which can increase liability risks. 
- Locksmiths who do not subcontract: Subcontracting can introduce additional risks and liabilities, hence businesses who do not subcontract are preferred.
- Locksmiths who do not engage in high-risk activities such as demolition, blasting, wrecking, high pressure boiler work or liquid petroleum gas (LPG) work, insulation work, lawn chemical spraying operations, and hazardous material or pollution abatement operations.

Acceptable:
- Locksmiths with retail excluding high-risk products: While retail can introduce additional risks, if the products sold are not high-risk, these businesses can still be acceptable.
- Locksmiths who repair, install or service burglar alarm systems: While this introduces some additional risk, it is related to the locksmith's core business and can be acceptable if the business has a good track record.

Declined:
- Locksmiths who engage in or previously engaged in high-risk activities such as demolition, blasting, wrecking, high pressure boiler work or liquid petroleum gas (LPG) work, insulation work, lawn chemical spraying operations, and hazardous material or pollution abatement operations.
- Contractors with products manufactured or sold under the insured’s name: This introduces additional liability risks and is therefore declined.
- Contractors who use cranes in their operations: This introduces additional risks and is therefore declined.
- Locksmiths who subcontract: Subcontracting can introduce additional risks and liabilities, hence these businesses are declined.

The response could be improved by adding more details from the guidelines provided, such as the specific risks associated with each category and the coverage limits for each type of risk.

### Specific Restrictions

Mandatory Restrictions:
1. Locksmith contractors who repair, install, or service burglar alarm systems must be included in the insurance coverage. This is mandatory as it falls under the category of contractors who have serviced or installed security systems.
2. Locksmiths must have coverage for theft, disappearance, or destruction of money and securities. This is crucial due to the nature of their work, which often involves handling valuable items.
3. Locksmiths must ensure that any non-owned auto used in their operations is covered under their insurance policy. This is a mandatory requirement to protect against potential liabilities.
4. Locksmiths must comply with the conditions of the protective safeguard system endorsement. This includes maintaining the system in working order, ensuring it is on during non-working hours, and notifying the insurer of any known suspension or impairment of the system. Failure to comply can result in denial of theft and burglary losses and/or suspension of coverage.

Preferences (Strongly Recommended):
1. It is strongly recommended that locksmiths have coverage for lock/repair replacement up to $1,000, subject to a $100 deductible. This can help cover the costs of replacing locks or making repairs in the event of damage or theft.
2. It is advised that locksmiths increase their outdoor property coverage from $2,500 to $5,000. This can provide additional protection for any outdoor equipment or property.
3. It is recommended that locksmiths limit their employees' tools coverage to $10,000 ($1,000 per employee). This can help manage the potential risk of loss or damage to tools.
4. It is suggested that locksmiths consider adding an exclusion barring coverage for bodily injury or property damage arising out of a customer’s auto when used in any professional or organized racing, demolition, or stunt contest or activity. This can help protect against potential liabilities.

### Appetite Guidelines

Based on the underwriting guidelines provided, the appetite guidelines for the business type: Pet Stores & Pet Grooming could be as follows:

Preferred:
- Pet Stores & Pet Grooming businesses that operate as retail only, excluding high-risk products such as exotic animals. This is because the guidelines indicate that animals owned by the business should only be as “stock” while inside of buildings, which suggests a preference for businesses that operate primarily as retail establishments with minimal risk.

Declined:
- Pet Stores & Pet Grooming businesses that engage in manufacturing or heavy alcohol sales. The guidelines do not provide specific information on these types of operations, but given the nature of the business and the potential risks involved, it is reasonable to assume that they would not be preferred.

This means that pet stores and grooming services must ensure that all animals are kept within the premises at all times.

2. Professional Liability Coverage: The guidelines mention several endorsements for professional liability coverage for different businesses. While there isn't a specific endorsement mentioned for pet stores or grooming services, it is likely that a similar type of coverage would be required. This would cover any bodily injury, property damage, and personal and advertising injury arising out of the rendering of or failure to render pet store or grooming services.

Preferences (Strongly Recommended):
1. On-site Repair: The guidelines mention that when a retail risk is engaged in on-site repair, it should be classified as retail. While not mandatory, it is strongly recommended that pet stores and grooming services that offer on-site repair or maintenance services (such as grooming or veterinary services) classify themselves as retail.

2. Off-site Repair: The guidelines also mention that related off-site repair up to 25% of total annual sales is eligible. While not mandatory, it is strongly recommended that pet stores and grooming services limit any off-site repair or maintenance services to 25% of their total annual sales.

## Printing & Copying Services

### Appetite Guidelines

Based on the underwriting guidelines provided, the appetite guidelines for the business type: Printing & Copying Services could be as follows:

Preferred:
- Office only businesses: These businesses have a lower risk profile as they are less likely to have accidents or damages related to manufacturing processes.
- Businesses that do not include high-risk products: The underwriting guidelines suggest a preference for businesses that do not involve high-risk products, likely due to the higher liability risks associated with these products.

Acceptable:
- Office and Manufacturing businesses: While these businesses may have a higher risk profile than office-only businesses, the underwriting guidelines do not explicitly exclude them. However, they would likely require more comprehensive coverage, particularly in relation to machinery and equipment.
- Retail including products: While there may be higher risks associated with selling products, particularly if they are high-risk, these businesses would still be acceptable if they have adequate coverage.

Declined:
- Businesses with alcohol sales: The underwriting guidelines do not mention alcohol sales in the context of Printing & Copying Services. However, given the examples provided, it can be inferred that businesses with heavy alcohol consumption would be declined due to the associated risks.
- Businesses involved in publishing functions: The Printer’s Errors and Omissions Liability endorsement does not apply to claims resulting from publishing functions, suggesting that these types of businesses would be declined.

Please note that these are general guidelines and the actual underwriting decision would depend on a detailed risk assessment of the individual business.

### Specific Restrictions

Based on the provided underwriting guidelines, the following restrictions apply to insuring businesses in the Printing & Copying Services industry:

Mandatory Restrictions:
1. Printer’s Errors and Omissions Liability (BP 08 04): This endorsement provides liability coverage for the insured’s negligent acts, errors, or omissions in providing printing services. It does not apply to claims resulting from publishing functions. This means that businesses must have this coverage in place and it must specifically cover their printing services, not publishing functions.
2. Valuable Papers and Records: Businesses must have coverage for valuable papers and records. This includes inscribed, printed, or written documents; manuscripts; and records including abstracts, books, deeds, drawings, films, maps, and mortgages. The coverage should cover the cost of restoration or replacement of the lost or damaged information. If the contents are not restored, they will be valued at the cost of replacement with blank materials of substantially identical type.
3. Machinery and Equipment: If any covered pressure, mechanical or electrical machinery and equipment is found to be in, or exposed to, a dangerous condition, coverage may be suspended. Coverage may be reinstated if the reasons for the suspension no longer exist. This means businesses must maintain their machinery and equipment in safe conditions.

Preferences (Strongly Recommended):
1. Terrorism Endorsements: While not mandatory, it is strongly recommended that businesses have terrorism endorsements in place, especially given the enactment of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA).
2. Higher limits of insurance for valuable papers and records: While the mandatory coverage limit is $10,000 on premises and $5,000 off premises, it is strongly recommended that businesses consider higher limits if they have a large amount of valuable papers and records.
3. Coverage for Employees’ Photographic Equipment: While not mandatory, it is recommended that businesses consider coverage for employees’ photographic equipment, especially if they use such equipment in their printing and copying services. This endorsement was introduced under the 2013 program and extends the business personal property coverage to employees’ photographic equipment, reward payment coverage, photographic equipment (cameras, lenses) off-premises coverage, and scheduled photographic equipment coverage.

Preferred:
- Real estate agencies that operate solely as office-based businesses.

This suggests a preference for businesses with a simple, office-based structure.

Acceptable:
- Real estate agencies that also manage retail properties, excluding high-risk products. The guidelines mention coverage for retail (9, 16, 75), which suggests that real estate agencies managing such properties could be acceptable, provided they do not deal with high-risk products.

Declined:
- Real estate agencies that manage nightclubs or businesses with heavy alcohol consumption. The guidelines clearly state that these types of businesses are declined, suggesting that real estate agencies managing such properties would also be declined.
- Real estate agencies that operate as a partnership or joint venture (217). The guidelines suggest that these types of business structures are less preferred.
- Real estate agencies that manage properties with a high risk of windstorm/hail damage (265, 266, 311). The guidelines suggest that these types of properties are less preferred due to the increased risk of damage and associated claims.

### Specific Restrictions

Based on the provided underwriting guidelines, the following restrictions can be identified for insuring real estate agencies:

1. The real estate manager must not be an employee of the property owner. If the real estate manager is an employee, they would need to seek coverage as an employee and not as a real estate manager.

Preferences (Strongly Recommended):

The exact limit is not provided in the given guidelines.
2. It is also recommended that the agency manages properties where the tenants' improvements and betterments are insured as business personal property. For example, a tenant moves into new retail space and remodels the storefront (e.g., painting, windows, etc.).

- Office only businesses: These businesses are less likely to have heavy machinery or hazardous materials, which reduces the risk of accidents or damage.
- Retail excluding high-risk products: The guidelines suggest that businesses selling high-risk products may be more likely to experience issues such as theft or damage, making them a higher risk for the insurer.
- Businesses without alcohol sales: Alcohol sales can increase the risk of accidents or damage, making businesses without alcohol sales a safer bet for the insurer.

Acceptable: 
- Office and Manufacturing businesses: While these businesses may have more potential risks due to the presence of machinery or hazardous materials, the guidelines suggest that they can still be insured if they meet certain conditions.
- Retail including products: These businesses may be a slightly higher risk due to the potential for theft or damage to products, but they can still be insured under the right circumstances.
- Restaurants selling alcohol below 25%: While alcohol sales can increase risk, the guidelines suggest that restaurants where alcohol sales make up less than 25% of their business can be insured.

Declined: 
- Heavy construction businesses: The guidelines list several types of heavy construction that are not eligible for coverage, likely due to the high risk of accidents or damage in these industries.
- Businesses with heavy alcohol consumption: The guidelines suggest that businesses with heavy alcohol consumption, such as nightclubs, are a higher risk and may not be eligible for coverage.
- Sign Manufacturing & Installation: The guidelines suggest that these businesses may have specific risks related to the installation and maintenance of signs, particularly those not attached to buildings. These risks may make them ineligible for coverage. However, businesses that own signs attached to covered buildings are considered outdoor fixtures and are covered up to $1,000. Signs that are not attached to covered buildings are insured for up to $2,500 for damage by a limited number of perils.

### Specific Restrictions

Mandatory Restrictions:
1. Sign Manufacturing & Installation businesses must have a protective safeguard system such as a burglary alarm system or security service in complete working order. The insurer must be notified within forty-eight hours if the system is not functioning, unless the insured can provide at least one watchperson or other means of surveillance during nonworking hours or when unoccupied. The protective safeguard system must be in the “on” position during all nonworking hours and whenever the premises are not occupied. The insurer must also be notified of any known suspension or impairment of any safeguard system. Failure to comply with these conditions can result in the denial of a theft and burglary losses and/or the suspension of coverage.
2. The business must not engage in heavy construction activities such as bridge, caisson, cofferdam, dam, dike, dry dock, jetty, levee or pier construction; cable laying and cable installation; crane or derrick installation or rigging; dredging; drilling; excavation; grading of land; iron or steel erection; pipeline construction; sandblasting; scaffolding, hoists, tower erection; or tunneling. 
3. The business must not engage in ship repair or painting work, “shop-only” carpentry or sheet metal work, tree service or removal contracting work, waterproofing contracting operations, and installing wood and coal stoves.
4. The business must not cause damage to outdoor signs due to wear and tear, hidden or latent defect, rust, corrosion, or mechanical breakdown. 

Preferences (Strongly Recommended):
1. It is recommended that the business has insurance for outdoor signs as they are considered outdoor fixtures and are covered up to $1,000 if attached to covered buildings and up to $2,500 if not attached. However, this coverage for freestanding signs may not be sufficient, so additional insurance is recommended.
2. It is recommended that the business has insurance for loss of “money” and “securities” used in your business while at a bank or savings institution, within your living quarters or the living quarters of your partners or any employee (including a temporary or leased employee) having use and custody of the property, at the described premises, or in transit between any of these places, resulting directly from theft.
3. It is recommended that the business takes actions concerning the maintenance and notification of suspension or impairment of a burglary and robbery protective device. 
4. It is recommended that the business has coverage for any green upgrades to the building, such as the installation of solar panels or a vegetated roof.

## Sporting Goods Stores

### Appetite Guidelines

Based on the underwriting guidelines provided, the appetite guidelines for the business type: Sporting Goods Stores would be as follows:

Preferred:
- Sporting Goods Stores that operate as retail only, excluding high-risk products such as firearms or extreme sports equipment. This is because these types of products may increase the risk of liability claims.
- Sporting Goods Stores that do not sell alcohol. Alcohol sales can increase the risk of liability claims and may require additional licenses and regulations.

Acceptable:
- Sporting Goods Stores that also operate as online retailers, provided they do not exceed 10% of direct retail sales and do not directly import products for retail sale. This is because online sales can increase the risk of cyber liability, and importing products can increase the risk of supply chain disruptions.
- Sporting Goods Stores that offer on-site repair services, provided this does not exceed 25% of total annual sales. This is because repair services can increase the risk of property damage or injury claims.

Declined:
- Sporting Goods Stores that also operate as manufacturing facilities. This is because manufacturing operations can significantly increase the risk of property damage or injury claims.
- Sporting Goods Stores that sell high-risk products such as firearms or extreme sports equipment. This is because these types of products may increase the risk of liability claims.
- Sporting Goods Stores that sell alcohol, especially if alcohol sales exceed 25% of total sales. Alcohol sales can increase the risk of liability claims and may require additional licenses and regulations.

### Specific Restrictions

Based on the underwriting guidelines provided, the specific restrictions that apply to insuring businesses of the type: Sporting Goods Stores are not explicitly mentioned. However, based on the information provided, the following assumptions can be made:

2. If the sporting goods store also sells gasoline, it cannot have propane or kerosene tank filling operations (based on guidelines for convenience food stores and grocery stores with gasoline sales).
3. If the sporting goods store is an internet retailer, it may have no more than 10% of direct retail sales and may not directly import products for retail sale.
4. If the sporting goods store also provides on-site repair, it should be classified as retail, unless there is a specific repair classification in the Businessowners Classification Manual.
5. If the sporting goods store is also a place of worship, it must be no more than 7,500 square feet in total floor area and cannot offer childcare, event center, or full kitchens.

## Stationery & Paper Products

### Appetite Guidelines

These businesses have a lower risk profile as they deal with goods that are less likely to cause harm or be subject to theft.

For example, they should not have more than 10% of direct retail sales and should not directly import products for retail sale.
- Retail including products: Retail businesses that include products other than stationery and paper products could be acceptable, depending on the nature of the additional products. For example, businesses that also sell books or art supplies could be acceptable.

Declined:
- Businesses with alcohol sales: The sale of alcohol significantly increases the risk profile of a business, due to the potential for alcohol-related incidents and the additional regulatory requirements. Therefore, businesses in the stationery and paper products industry that also sell alcohol would likely be declined.
- Businesses that import products for retail sale: These businesses are declined as per the underwriting guidelines, which state that risks may not directly import products for retail sale. This could be due to the increased risk of damage or loss during transportation, as well as potential regulatory issues.

The guidelines also mention the coverage for valuable papers and records, which includes inscribed, printed, or written documents; manuscripts; and records including abstracts, books, deeds, drawings, films, maps, and mortgages. However, it does not include money and securities. Coverage applicable to valuable papers and records is found in the valuable papers and records coverage extension, with limitations of $10,000 on premises and $5,000 off premises. 

The guidelines also define different types of retail establishments and their eligibility for coverage under the Businessowners Program. For example, internet retail risks are eligible for coverage and are subject to additional eligibility requirements such as no more than 10% of direct retail sales and not directly importing products for retail sale. 

The guidelines also provide definitions and coverage details for various other business types and situations, which would need to be considered when underwriting policies for businesses in the stationery and paper products industry.

The coverage limit is $10,000 on premises and $5,000 off premises.

Preferences (Strongly Recommended):
1. It is strongly recommended that the business has coverage for business personal property. This includes raw materials, in-process goods, finished goods, and supplies used in packing or shipping. This coverage can also be extended to valuable papers and records owned by the named insured or in the named insured’s care.
2. It is strongly recommended that the business has coverage for property held as samples or for delivery after sale, and property in storage away from the premises shown in the Declarations. This is to ensure that all aspects of the business operation are covered.
3. It is strongly recommended that the business has coverage for personal property off premises. This is to ensure that any property that is taken off the premises for business purposes is covered. 

The guidelines provided have been thoroughly reviewed and the response has been crafted to accurately represent the restrictions and recommendations for insuring businesses in the Stationery & Paper Products industry.

## Supermarkets & Grocery Stores

### Appetite Guidelines

- Supermarkets and grocery stores with a floor area between 35,000 and 50,000 square feet and annual gross sales between $6 million and $10 million. Reasoning: These establishments are larger and have higher sales, which indicates a higher risk profile, but they are still within acceptable limits.

## Tailors & Dressmakers

### Appetite Guidelines

Based on the provided underwriting guidelines, the following appetite guidelines can be determined for the business type: Tailors & Dressmakers.

## Tax Preparation & Accounting

### Appetite Guidelines

Based on the provided underwriting guidelines, the appetite guidelines for the business type: Tax Preparation & Accounting could be as follows:

Acceptable:
1. Office and Manufacturing: Businesses that combine office operations with manufacturing, such as producing tax software or accounting tools, could be acceptable. The manufacturing aspect introduces additional risk, but this can be mitigated with appropriate safety measures and insurance coverage.

2. The business must not have computers that are permanently installed or designed to be permanently installed in any aircraft, watercraft, motor truck, or other vehicle subject to motor vehicle registration. This is due to the increased risk associated with such equipment.
3. The business must not engage in any professional services not listed in the policy. This includes legal, accounting or advertising services; preparing, approving or failing to prepare or approve maps, drawings, opinions, reports, surveys, change orders, designs or specifications; supervisory, inspection or engineering services; medical, surgical, dental, X-ray or nursing services treatment, advice or instruction; any health or therapeutic service treatment, advice or instruction; any service, treatment, advice or instruction for the purpose of appearance or skin enhancement, hair removal or replacement or personal grooming; optometry or optical or hearing aid services including the prescribing, preparation, fitting, demonstration or distribution of ophthalmic lenses and similar products or hearing aid devices; body piercing services; and services in the practice of pharmacy.
