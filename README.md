# Actuarial Agentic AI

Welcome to **Actuarial Agentic AI** â€” a series of projects dedicated to exploring the application of agentic artificial intelligence in actuarial underwriting and related fields.

## Overview
This repository aims to demonstrate how agentic AI can be leveraged across various actuarial processes, including:

- **Smart Data Generation**: Automating and enhancing data creation tailored for actuarial models.
- **Automated Processes**: Designing frameworks that enable end-to-end decisions with for more efficient processes.
- **Ethical Considerations**: Exploring the responsible design and deployment of agentic systems in underwriting.
- **Other Applications**: Investigating additional opportunities for agentic AI in actuarial science, such as risk modeling, portfolio management, and customer experience optimization.

## Goals
- Develop practical examples and frameworks demonstrating agentic AI in underwriting.
- Promote ethical standards and best practices in the use of agentic AI.
- Foster innovation in the intersection of actuarial science and autonomous systems.
